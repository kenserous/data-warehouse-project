## Project Description
Project 2 involves designing and implementing a graph database using Python and Neo4j.<br>
The project uses a modified dataset based on fatalities in Australia as of December 2024. This dataset is provided by the University.<br>
The full report on the project has been attached in the repository, under the file *CITS3401_Project_Report_Graph.pdf*.

## Project Structure
- *nodes_relationship*: folder containing the nodes and relationships created from the ETL process
- *etl.ipynb*: Jupyter notebook for the ETL process of creating nodes and relationships
- *graph_schema.png*: graph database schema
- *cypher*: all Cypher scripts used to build the database, including population of nodes and relationships, and queries.
- *Project2_Dataset.csv*: the raw dataset provided by the University, to be used for the project.

## Tools Used
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook):** ETL
- [**Arrows App:**](https://arrows.app/) graph database design
- **Neo4j & Cypher:** graph database implementation and queries
